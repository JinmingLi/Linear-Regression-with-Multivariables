# Linear-Regression-with-Multivariables

This project includes the codes I wrote in Matlab to solve linear regression with multivariables.

The essence is the same as that with one variable. I first normalized the features for the purpose of making gradient descent converge more quickly. Then I computed the cost function J(theta) and used two different methods to output the theta parameter: gradient descent and normal equations.
